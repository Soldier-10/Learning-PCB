This is my personal journey in learning PCB Design and Manufacturing

This is a try at learning the basics of PCB schematic, placing, routing and manufacturing. It as a tutorial by Robert Feranec (https://www.linkedin.com/in/robfer/) on FEDEVEL Academy. The aim is to make an Arduino UNO Board.

## KEY LEARNING POINTS:
01- Drawing Schematic and Creating Libraries
02- PCB Component Placement
03- PCB Layout
04- Documentation
05- 3D views and Signing off Projects and versions
